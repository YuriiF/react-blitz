# react-blitz

My personal react boilerplate - not production ready - *WIP*

## Motivation

## Features

## Folder structure

`react-blitz` boilerplate leverages the Atomic Design methodology by which you can better organize your UI components. This can be achieved by separating components to `atoms`, `molecules`, `organizms`, `templates` and `pages`.

In case off `react-blitz` to be as simple as posible, I don't like to provide new terms specialy for newcomers.
