# Templates

At the template stage, we break our chemistry analogy to get into language that
makes more sense to our clients and our final output.
Templates consist mostly of groups of `sections` stitched together to form `pages`.
Itâ€™s here where we start to see the design coming together and start seeing things
like layout in action.

Templates are very concrete and provide context to all these relatively abstract
`blocks` and `sections`. Templates are also where clients start seeing the final
design in place. In my experience working with this methodology,
`templates` begin their life as HTML wireframes,
but over time increase fidelity to ultimately become the final deliverable.
