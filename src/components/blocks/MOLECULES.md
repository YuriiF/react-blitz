# Blocks (Molecules)

Blocks are analogy to [Molecules](https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/#molecules)
in atomic design methodology.

Blocks combining atoms together.
Blocks are groups of atoms bonded together and are the smallest
fundamental units of a compound. These blocks take on their own properties and
serve as the backbone of our design systems.

For example, a form label, input or button aren’t too useful by themselves,
but combine them together as a form and now they can actually do something together.

Building up to `blocks` from `elements` encourages a
“do one thing and do it well” mentality.
While `blocks` can be complex, as a rule of thumb they are
relatively simple combinations of `elements` built for reuse.
