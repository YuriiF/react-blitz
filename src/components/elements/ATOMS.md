# Elements (Atoms)

Elements are analogy to [Atoms](https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/#atoms)
in atomic design methodology.

Elements are the basic building blocks.
Applied to web interfaces, elements are our HTML tags,
such as a form label, an input or a button.

Elements can also include more abstract elements like color palettes,
fonts and even more invisible aspects of an interface like animations.

Like elements in nature they’re fairly abstract and often not terribly
useful on their own. However, they’re good as a reference in the context of a
pattern library as you can see all your global styles laid out at a glance.
