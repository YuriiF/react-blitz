# Sections (Organisms)

Sections are analogy to [Organisms](https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/#organisms)
in atomic design methodology.

`Blocks` give us some building blocks to work with,
and we can now combine them together to form `sections`.
Sections are groups of `blocks` joined together to form a relatively complex,
distinct section of an interface.

`Sections` can consist of similar and/or different block types.
For example, a masthead `section` might consist of diverse components like a logo,
primary navigation, search form, and list of social media channels.
But a “product grid” `section` might consist of the same `block`
(possibly containing a product image, product title and price)
repeated over and over again.

Building up from blocks to sections encourages creating standalone, portable,
reusable components.
