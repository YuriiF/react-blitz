# Pages

`Pages` are specific instances of `templates`. Here,
placeholder content is replaced with real representative content
to give an accurate depiction of what a
user will ultimately see.

`Pages` are the highest level of fidelity and because they’re the most tangible,
it’s typically where most people in the process spend most of their time and
what most reviews revolve around.

The `page` stage is essential as it’s where we test the effectiveness of the
design system. Viewing everything in context allows us to loop back to modify
our `blocks`, `sections`, and `templates` to better address the real context
of the design.
